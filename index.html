        <h3 class="main_div-text">According to
            the
            World Health Organization(WHO) in 2021, there are over 1.5 billion
            people around the world (nearly 20% of the global population) who live with hearing loss. They often face
            challenges in understanding individuals without hearing loss.<br><br>Hearing loss is a common but often
            overlooked disability affecting millions of people
            worldwide. It is a condition that disrupts the ability to perceive sounds fully or partially, creating
            communication barriers and impacting the overall quality of life for those affected.<br><br>The inability to
            actively participate
            in social gatherings can lead to a sense of alienation. Many people with hearing loss avoid social events,
            fearing the embarrassment of misunderstanding conversations or constantly asking others to repeat
            themselves. Over time, this isolation can lead to feelings of loneliness and detachment from the community.
