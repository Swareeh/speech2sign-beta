# How does it work?
The function of this website is very simple and basic

- It detects speech and converts it into text.
- It takes this text and checks for words in the dataset given.
- If the word is found it displays that image/gif.
- If the word is not found the website will finger spell the letters in the word.

# Usage:
- You can check out the final version [here](https://github.com/Swareeh/Speech2Sign)<br>
- Check out all the other previous versions [here](https://swareeh.github.io/speech2sign-beta)

# Problems you might face:
- Even the final version is not perfect. It's still buggy and may require multiple reloads to work properly. 
- There might be some browser compatibility issues as well. (Works fine on chrome)
