Need to add:
Make the website responsive in multiple devices
Build about developers page [PRIORITY ONE]





THINGS TO PUSH TO MAIN CODE:
Disable scroll during toggled nav bar (Mobile)



Tried but not working:
add an exit button while the converter is running





Less Important:
Search for other animations or find the letter 'j' in simax animations

Patched:
BUG: Video is bg is loading slow
BUG: When the button is clicked a second time before the 1st one is complete, it overlaps.
BUG: file path is case sensitive in github

Added Features:
Words to sign (using if and elif statments)
return to main website option
Edit bg video 1min.. (reduce file size)
change id of speech to text "click_to_convert" to "mic_btn" or something.
Combine the UI and UX of the converter
Create a website for presenting.
