Need to add:
Make the website responsive in multiple devices

if text == blank, break


Tried but not working:
add an exit button while the converter is running





Less Important:
Search for other animations or find the letter 'j' in simax animations

Patched:
Disable scroll during toggled nav bar (Mobile)
BUG: Video is bg is loading slow
BUG: When the button is clicked a second time before the 1st one is complete, it overlaps.
BUG: file path is case sensitive in github

Added Features:
Build about developers page
Words to sign (using if and elif statments)
return to main website option
Edit bg video 1min.. (reduce file size)
change id of speech to text "click_to_convert" to "mic_btn" or something.
Combine the UI and UX of the converter
Create a website for presenting.
